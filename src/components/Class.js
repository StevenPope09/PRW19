/* 
We use classes in React when we want to expand on a function. The classes allow you to setState() where a normal function is
more of just passing in props and returning a React element. A class also allows an easier way to set a state. If you need a 
state in your component your choices are rather create a class which can setState() or you would have lift the state up to the parent
component and pass it down the fucntional component via props. To me creating a Class is the way to go when faced with these choices.
